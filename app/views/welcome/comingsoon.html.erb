			<h3>Here's one of many resources I'll be giving you: high-quality images and icons.</h3>
			<%= image_tag "images-thanks.png" %>
			<p>I've literally spent $1,000's of dollars on images because I didn't know where to find <em>beautiful, high-quality, FREE images</em>.  I'll share the ones I've collected and how to find them yourself.</p>
			<p>This is my way of saying thank you for signing up on lauraleeflores.com.  I sincerely hope this is an extremely valuable resource for you on your journey to making remarkable websites.</p>

			<h2>Now I Have a Request...</h2>
			<p>I'm working hard creating resources and training that <em>I think</em> you'll love. But, I'm honestly not sure if I'm focusing on what you <em>most want to learn</em>.</p>
			<p>Let's say we were sitting together at the computer for the next 15 minutes.  And you could ask me anything about websites, what would you want to me to show you?  What is the first thing you would want to learn about?</p>
