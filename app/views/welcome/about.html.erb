				<p>First, you must realize that making an amazing website is not easy.  But, if you're willing to stick with me (I'm going to be creating some training guides for you.) I guarantee you can do it and your users will love you for it.</p>
				<p>You must be willing to take a user-centered approach.  This isn't as easy as it sounds.  It's a philosophy and approach that is different than how most people create websites.  But, that's why you and your websites will stand out.</p>
				<p>The only other requirement is a willingness to take a step.</p>

				<p><span id="bold"><em>User-Centered Approach</em></span> - The core and foundation of creating amazing websites is this approach. It's more than an approach though, it's a philosphy and belief system. It's a way of thinking and paradigm. Embracing this one aspect will completely change (for the better!) the quality of websites you make.</p>
				<p><span id="bold"><em>Ruby on Rails</em></span> - In order to create amazing websites you need to know the technical side of things.  I will teach you to code.  I love this part.  I will cover the Ruby programming language, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS and all these fun topics that are essential to creating websites.</p>
				<p><span id="bold"><em>Beautiful and Minimal Design</em></span> - Design is arguably one of the most important aspects of a website. If you want your website to be amazing you cannot overlook this aspect, whether you want to be a designer or not. You really have two good options, hire a great designer or learn how to make great design. The good news is design is a skill that you can learn whether you consider yourself "creative" or not.</p>
				<p><span id="bold"><em>Persuasive Architecture</em></span> - If you were creating a building you would plan out and think through the flow of people visiting your building and how they would get from one room to another.  You would probably also consider if there's a specific place you want them to go and what kind of impression you want to make. Amazing websites require the same type of architecture.</p>

				<p>I've been working on websites in a professional setting since 2006.  I have a masters degree in applied psychology with an emphasis in human-computer interaction which basically means I understand the psychology behind how to make a website awesome. I have hired, trained, and managed a team of usability and web analytic professionals. I was the lead web analyst for the University of Idaho.</p>
				<p>I have developed and taught university courses on topics such as human-computer interaction, principles of usability, introduction to psychology, cognitive development, and others. I began learning HTML and CSS in college and in 2012 I jumped into learning Ruby on Rails. I learned in order to create a business idea and I had no idea I would love it so much.</p>
				<p>Most of my time is spent as an entrepreneur creating web applictions in Ruby on Rails.</p>
